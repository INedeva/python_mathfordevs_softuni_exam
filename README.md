Monte Carlo Simulation

The problem we would like to address is the calculation of the area under a curve using Monte Carlo method for numerical integration and evaluating its accuracy and timeliness in comparison to the trapezoidal method for calculating the same result.

Here you are provided with a brief description, implementation using python and testing using Student's t-test with one sample. Having in mind the null hypothesis (where the mean of the distribution of the results of the Monte Carlo integration is equal to the result of the trapezoidal rule for integration), we did not achieve any significant result and were not able to reject it.
